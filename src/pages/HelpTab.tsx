        <Typography variant='caption'>

        <Divider style={{ marginBottom: 10 }} /> <Typography variant='body2'> What is a transaction hash? </Typography>
        <Typography variant='caption'>
        A transaction hash represents a data entry on the Concordium blockchain, which stores the document hash and time stamp on an immutable, decentralized record that can be retrieved at a later stage.

        <Typography variant='caption'>
        Each registration requires paying a small fee to the network of blockchain operators. Concordium Foundation has decided to sponsor a certain amount of registration every day. A pay-per-service solution might be offered later for anyone to set up.
